						<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23912" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy5/"></a>Yuichi Yokoyama’s first full-length graphic novel, <em>Travel</em>,
 tells the story of a journey, and ends with a destination. Over the 
course of its nearly 200 silent pages, readers watch the progress of a 
train’s riders through a series of stunning, occasionally futuristic 
landscapes, and are thereby implicated in the journey themselves. The 
book’s final few pages show the three passengers whose embarkation 
begins the story leaving the train and taking a quick walk to a sea 
shore, where the froth of crashing waves prohibits further movement, 
literally ending the comic in its tracks. It’s a bold statement about 
form: sequences of panels depict motion, and when the motion must stop 
so must the comic.&nbsp; Every comic is a journey, a movement through 
something to something, and as such the only logical end point is a 
cessation of that movement.</p>
<p>Yokoyama’s second graphic novel, the recently translated <em>Garden</em>,
 also follows the logic of motion from beginning to end, of journey to 
destination. But in this book Yokoyama complicates things: <em>Garden</em>
 also begins with a destination, and for over 300 pages readers are 
invited to wonder if the journey it depicts is the same utilitarian 
movement through space depicted in <em>Travel</em>, or an end unto itself.</p>
<p><em><a rel="attachment wp-att-23917" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy1/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23917" title="yy1" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy1.jpg" alt="" height="923" width="650"></a>Garden</em>
 begins with a strong echo of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave. A handful of
 the artist’s humanoid, fashion-forward characters stand assembled 
before a guard wearing a mask printed with a pattern that encourages the
 eyes to unfocus, and are denied entrance to the garden that memories of
 <em>Travel</em> suggest they have come a long way to see. Luckily, 
there is a breach in the wall that sections off the garden from the 
outside world — an outside world, crucially, that we are never allowed 
to see. By the end of page one, the characters we follow for the 
entirety of the narrative are through the wall and into the garden.</p>
<p>We will not see them leave. For the rest of the book, the characters 
negotiate ever more complex and physically demanding man-made 
topographical features, frequently risking life and limb without a 
mention of the fact that they are doing so. The dialogue betrays no 
interiority whatsoever, with completely interchangeable voices 
alternating between describing the bizarre sights their owners are 
witnessing and speculating on their purposes and the methods of their 
creation. Yokoyama’s fanciful setup nails the basic absurdity of modern 
leisure: the most privileged among us — the ones with the lives we 
believe are ideal — “work” by staring at screens, and “recreate” by 
climbing mountains.</p>
<p><em><a rel="attachment wp-att-23918" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23918" title="yy2" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy2.jpg" alt="" height="467" width="650"></a>Garden</em>
 is more than satire, however, and Yokoyama’s sights are set much higher
 than the follies of vacationing. The nature of the obstacles his band 
of wanderers encounter progresses slowly but surely over the course of 
the book. Waterfalls of simple rubber balls and fountains made of 
stacked bowls give way to planters made of automobiles and resting areas
 constructed from airplane parts. Soon the terrain is incorporating 
giant paper pyramids, a winding maze of irrigation channels that forces 
its occupants to literally get their feet wet, and motorized blocks of 
rock that ferry riders up grooves cut into the side of mountains.</p>
<p>As Yokoyama’s characters move through the vast environment his 
drawings of them pull back further and further, taking in more and more 
of both people and landscape. Soon the characters drawn into single 
panels number in the hundreds, cut off not by any end to their ranks but
 by the limited size of the pages. And the garden they have broken into 
is even more endless, if endlessness could be quantified — swallowing 
the throngs that surge slowly through it, its entrance the only boundary
 we ever see. The unreality of death for these characters becomes 
obvious after a time: they give no pause to paddling across a vast river
 on thin blocks of some unidentified substance or shimmying across a 
single bar suspended thousands of feet in the air as waterfalls spray 
them with mist. Pain seems not to be a factor either: a group tumble 
down a kilometer-high cliffside is merely a means of getting from one 
place to another. And one begins to wonder about the relevance of time 
in the garden after one character mentions that four pages’ worth of 
firepole descents have taken “over an hour”. Taken together and combined
 with the miles-wide map the characters piece together from a desert 
made of aerial surveillance photos, it’s enough to force a deeply 
fascinating metaphorical reading of Yokoyama’s text. This journey is not
 one undertaken by individuals, but by humanity as a whole. And wherever
 the infinite stream of participants came from, it must have been 
somewhere much smaller than this place. Yokoyama’s garden is no mere 
repository for plant life. It is the garden of earthly delights, an 
entire world full of technological constructions as disarmingly bizarre 
as those in the world around us would seem to someone who had never 
encountered them before.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23923" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy3/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23923" title="yy3" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy3.jpg" alt="" height="2165" width="604"></a>The
 purpose of this world’s existence, however, becomes a more and more 
engaging question as the complexity of the environment continues to 
increase. An indoor maze can only be traversed by crawling through 
sections, and features doors that open into rooms of quicksand and 
endless chasms. The maze leads into a library full of books closer to 
the size of skyscrapers than the insubstantial things we’re used to; 
books that taken together seem to contain a pictorial index of 
everything in the world. Unseen projectors begin to beam gargantuan 
images of the characters’ faces onto the travelers as they trudge 
onward. The total deadpan of Yokoyama’s dialogue, refreshingly funny at 
first, begins to seem more and more sensical as the book wears on — 
given these humbling, ultimately unfathomable surroundings, what else is
 there to do but describe and wonder?&nbsp; One begins to admire 
Yokoyama’s characters for their ability to keep up such constant patter;
 we, after all, read the book and react to its contents in silence.</p>
<p>The states of passive reception and frequent bafflement put forward 
by the dialogue, along with the basic story structure of the exploratory
 journey through wholly unfamiliar climes, invites another reading: that
 of the drug narrative. Yokoyama’s drawing, often verging on abstraction
 and full of lines used as much for visual noise as depiction, touches 
on an unconventional but vivid psychedelia. The tinges of paranoia and 
surveillance sliding around the edges of the book and its idea-driven 
plot progression recall William Burroughs and Grant Morrison. Too, the 
place Yokoyama is pulling his visions from seems to be one completely 
beyond the world around us, a place of pure and fully-realized 
hallucination that most minds can only reach with the crutch of chemical
 additives. But the pinpoint cleanliness of Yokoyama’s black and white 
graphic design, the architectural logic underpinning his every 
construction, and the clarity sparkling behind the methodical page 
layouts that lead the reader through his story at a remarkably even pace
 all suggest that this work is coming from a place of total 
lucidity.&nbsp; As the chaos of the characters’ journey beats itself 
into order, it becomes more and more apparent that Yokoyama’s rational 
mind is in full control of what is being put on the page.</p>
<p>After navigating a landscape of towering escalators and a strange 
village in which “there are no normal houses”, the group is driven into a
 video-viewing room by an obstacle that is impossible to defeat, the 
fury of nature manifested as a vicious tornado. Here holographic 
projections quickly restate the journey their viewers have just been on:
 placid landscapes give way to more technological manmade ones — but 
then the bombs begin to fall onto panoramas that stand revealed as the 
ones we have just moved through. Multiple images are projected on top of
 one another in streams of random information too fast to make sense of,
 too overwhelming to be fully described in the reassuring catalog voice 
that has carried us through the narrative thus far. Volleys of balls 
begin to fire at bullet force from the walls and ricochet around the 
room.&nbsp; It’s impossible to turn anything off. The only solution is 
escape; the blind wrath of the natural world is in the end preferable to
 a digital environment spiraled out of control and into something that 
seems very much like malice. As the characters flee from the digitized 
version of the world they live in, it all becomes clear. The journey we 
have just seen is our own, from simple tools and playthings through 
bending the natural world to our purposes, from industrial machinery to a
 digital landscape that contains more information than can ever be 
contemplated. And into the hurricane.</p>
<p>It’s such a highly pessimistic meditation on what humanity has 
created that it’s difficult not to view the characters’ final flight 
with something like bitterness. And when the thronged mass of all 
humanity closes the book by filing one by one into a small rock room 
with a campfire burning in its center, it certainly seems like the 
conclusion is a hopeless one. Is this really the only solution, a return
 to the cave? A sacrifice of all the strange beauty that’s brought us 
this far? The answer turns out to be both yes and no.&nbsp; In the 
confines of this small, safe space that somehow has enough room in it 
for everyone, we see two characters touch for the first time, as one 
asks another who has salvaged a remnant of the technological world — his
 camera — to see some of the pictures he has taken of the place they’ve 
been forced to stop moving through. Everyone gathers around to see, and 
the narrative ends with its characters performing their first action 
that couldn’t be accomplished by mechanized vehicles or robotic probes: 
standing in company with one another, ready to enjoy the memories 
brought on by signs that they have been somewhere, that they have done 
something.</p>
<p>There’s a metafictional reading to be had from this ending, in which 
the photos constitute the comic we’ve just read, but the real thrill is 
in seeing the Warholian Yokoyama, who famously declared his intent to 
delete the emotion from his work, putting forth a quiet, understated 
kind of humanism that, after the epic journey undertaken to reach it, 
feels completely earned as a destination.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23916" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy4/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23916" title="Baby Boom" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy4.jpg" alt="" height="867" width="650"></a>If <em>Garden</em>’s
 final moment of humanity feels like a considered accession, however, 
the short works collected in Yokoyama’s next, sadly untranslated book, <em>Baby Boom</em>,
 constitute a fully committed, passionate embrace. Save for the basic 
element of enigma that swims over panels that stand up to scrutiny as 
both figurative and abstract visual information, everything about 
Yokoyama’s established drawing style has been upended from page one. The
 immediate shock is that of seeing Yokoyama comics in color: bright and 
luminous, <em>Baby Boom</em>’s marker-drawn panels have a highly 
appealing airiness to them, filled with strokes of hue that float 
against a white background, uninhibited by the pages’ total lack of 
black space. The artist’s use of his new tool is impressive from the 
first, with immediately pleasing combinations of two or three tones 
creating distinct grounds figure-object separations in each panel. 
There’s an ease of access to every page that’s absent in Yokoyama’s 
black and white work, no matter whether the eye is engaging the drawings
 as story or abstraction. These are pictures that pull you in with sheer
 prettiness.</p>
<p>Beyond the color, though, the work showcased in <em>Baby Boom</em> turns away from the logical acme that drives Yokoyama’s previous books in favor of something more fleeting, more <em>felt</em>
 than thought out. Yokoyama has gone back to silent comics here, and 
except for the lines that lay out the gridded panel borders, there is no
 evidence of the ruler at play on these pages. The lines that make up <em>Baby Boom</em>
 embrace the spontaneous imperfections contained in human hands — 
thinning and thickening, doubling back and looping over themselves, 
tracing the impressions of geometric shapes more than actually drafting 
them, condensing into joyous bits of outright scribble in the shadows 
and the solid blocks. Even the colored space within the thick marker 
lines themselves defies uniformity. Here and there it fuzzes out into 
the white surface of the paper, condenses into a spot of purer color to 
indicate extra pressure from Yokoyama’s fingertips, or pulls up and 
gives way to a rough grain where the strokes end. Yokoyama’s lines 
aren’t the flowing brush trails of Paul Pope or the spiderwebbing coils 
of Guido Crepax, but they’re as effective a primer in the sensual 
qualities of comic book artwork.&nbsp; Every line put on the page in <em>Baby Boom</em> is quick and decisive, full of an infectious joy.</p>
<p>It’s an artistic approach that’s perfectly matched to its subject 
matter, which presents a series of vignettes — some barely snapshots of 
moments, others longer meditations on single themes — centering around 
the warm, definitively human interactions of two characters. Yokoyama’s 
character designs leave behind the look of humanity almost completely as
 a result of <em>Baby Boom</em>’s simplified graphic approach (one 
resembles a man’s body with a head something like a bird’s, the other a 
dandelion puff or perhaps a baby chick), but it’s impossible not to read
 the dynamic of father and son into the scenes they share. The 
bird-headed dad feeds the fluffy kid with a baby bottle; the kid builds a
 tower out of blocks that the dad helps him finish when it gets too 
tall; the two clean the house, visit a playground, and go to an open-air
 market where the dad buys the kid a chewing gum and a soda.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23912" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy5/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23912" title="Baby Boom" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy5.jpg" alt="" height="459" width="650"></a>The
 sense of joy in these sequences is predominant, moreso so than any one 
picture or idea.&nbsp; Some of the stories are formalist explorations — 
an eight-page scene depicting a game of catch between father and son 
changes color schemes halfway but sticks to a rigid, dense fifteen-panel
 grid throughout, providing an authoritative object lesson in the 
dynamics of back-and-forth motion across a page — while others are 
almost like drawing journals, consisting of hastily scrawled landscapes 
whose great virtue is the energy with which they’re drawn, the 
characters seemingly added in as near-afterthoughts.&nbsp; Occasionally 
the amount of linework squeezed into a single panel or the alien quality
 of the ritual being enacted on a page becomes too much, and the eye 
moves into a different mode of viewing, following lines instead of 
characters, color relationships instead of panel progression. But it 
never feels as though we’re missing anything: the spark of life is in 
these lines regardless of how successfully we’re able to piece them 
together.</p>
<p>Through it all the sense of real caring — even love — between these 
beings is so strong that the space between their figures ends up 
functioning as a visual device in and of itself.&nbsp; The eye can’t 
help but close the distance between them when they share panel space, 
and when they don’t we end up wondering where the other one has gone. As
 content it’s hardly the earth-shaking experimental literature of <em>Garden</em>,
 but it feels like the only valid point of progression from that work. 
After taking in the world and humanity as a whole, it seems only right 
that Yokoyama should narrow his gaze to focus on some of the smaller 
stories that build the one big one, and in doing so be touched enough by
 the legitimacy of the emotion that they carry to create a new style for
 drawing them with. Each of <em>Baby Boom</em>’s stories, no matter how 
trivial or even banal the events depicted in them are, is bound to pull a
 smile from all but the stoniest of faces. That the overall idea of the 
stories here isn’t anything particularly new or individual, doesn’t hurt
 the work at all, and the archetypal quality of the stories ends up a 
virtue at many points.&nbsp;<em>Baby Boom</em> is a book about how the 
world is a beautiful place, how living in it can be a very wonderful 
thing, and how the presence of others is what keeps happiness alive in 
us.</p>
<p>The comic’s standout sequence, however, comes near its end, and it 
suggests that Yokoyama may cherish what he has found in his exploration 
of pure humanism, but he is not fully satisfied by it. Six stripped 
down, backgroundless eight-grid pages of father and son contorting 
themselves in expressive dance moves beneath the glitter of a disco ball
 suddenly explode into widescreen, pyrotechnic shots of a huge crowd 
gyrating beneath strobing spotlights, the color scheme changing 
violently with every new page, culminating in one of the book’s only two
 uses of black linework. Two pages later the characters are flying out 
into the starry embrace of space.&nbsp; It’s about as purely musical as 
comics have ever gotten, as immediate and propulsive as the bass kicking
 in under the percussion track on a dance club’s roaring sound system. 
Yokoyama uses color and a newfound sympathy for characters to bring the 
human into his comics’ topics of discourse in <em>Baby Boom</em>, but by
 the time the book finishes it seems like what he really wants to do is 
cut heads with eye-popping, formalist color comics. Thankfully, in <em>Color Engineering</em>, his most recent release, he does just that — and with a mastery that few before him have.</p>
<p><em>Color Engineering</em> opens with an explosion. A four-panel, 
vertical-orientation page of painted comics, its surface battered to the
 point of impressionism with white brushstrokes, depicts what the 
explanatory end notes identify as “a round iron sphere or something” but
 looks for all the world like a planet orbiting in space slowly breaking
 apart, ripped asunder by internal force. The following spread is given 
over to a single painting of the explosion, rendered in violent orange 
and green and blue and pink, smoke billowing everywhere, chunks of 
debris flying, brushstrokes gloriously smeared. It’s a note-perfect 
announcement of intent: this is going to be the most dynamic, 
brute-force comic you’ve ever seen, but it kills softly, with a master 
painter’s attention to texture and detail. This, finally, is Yokoyama’s 
arrival at the idiom of art-comix, of the primary importance of the 
substance on the page.&nbsp;<em>Color Engineering </em>translates<em> Baby Boom</em>’s
 affection for the human into a fascination with investigating how much 
evidence of the human hand at work a piece can bear while still 
retaining its content.</p>
<p>The exploding planet as beginning, however, also calls back to a very
 different though no less masterful narrative. The destruction of 
Krypton, Superman’s cauldron of birth, was the zero point for the 
creation of what became American comics’ best-known idiom; <em>Color Engineering</em>
 is Yokoyama’s first book to be released simultaneously in America and 
Japan. The audacity of the opening pages borders on braggadocio — here 
comes the next comic to be as important as that one was, it thunders. 
And indeed, <em>Color Engineering</em> isn’t entirely unlike superhero 
comics, if one can see past the marvelous filter of Yokoyama’s stylistic
 gestures for a moment or two. This is a return to the theme of the 
artist’s first book, <em>New Engineering</em>, which was mainly 
concerned with various massive and powerful machines re-terraforming 
virgin natural environments into constructions presumably designed for 
some unknown human use.&nbsp;<em>Color Engineering</em> mixes stories that recall <em>Garden</em>
 into the formula, juxtaposing the machines’ handiwork with the attempts
 made to understand them by the humans they surround. It all boils down 
to monolithic, unknowable forces acting on an environment that also 
contains living inhabitants.&nbsp; But where the prospect was 
paranoia-inducing — even out-and-out frightening — in <em>Garden</em>, 
here in color and buffered by the unflappable tone of Yokoyama’s 
dialogue, it feels more like the workings divinity: perhaps 
unfathomable, but more benign than malicious. In this aspect, <em>Color Engineering</em> is like a superhero comic without any characters, a chronicle of earth-shaking power and its effect on the world around it.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23919" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy7/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23919" title="yy7" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy7.jpg" alt="" height="474" width="650"></a>As
 a thread to follow over the length of an entire book that’s pretty 
abstract, and rightly so: Yokoyama’s pictures embrace abstraction here 
like never before, the new medium of paint pushing the comics page 
toward a new identity as a vividly colored noise container, its panel 
borders as much a tool for dictating compositional shape and color 
boundaries as plot pace and moment-to-moment storytelling. Yokoyama’s 
canvases read like Mark Rothko working over Kirby layouts, amplified and
 dynamic with massive slabs of color arranged in bracingly graceful 
relationships to one another. Even on the more conventionally drawn and 
colored pages, though, <em>Color Engineering</em> follows the logic of 
painting as much as comics. Every panel is a fully composed unit unto 
itself, certainly contributing to something greater than the sum of its 
parts, but more striking on first view as something spectacular in 
isolation.</p>
<p>Yokoyama’s reading of the single panel as canvas astounds again and 
again, inviting switchups of medium right into the middle of stories, 
keeping the reader forever on their toes for the next drastic upending 
of a narrative’s established order.&nbsp; Inked pages colored with 
marker give way to ones colored in thick gobs of paint before the lines 
drop out completely, leaving coats of pure color engaged in abstracted 
spatial relationships with one another before suddenly switching into 
panels of colored, screentoned linework so precise that they could have 
come from a technical manual. Eventually even photography works its way 
into the comics, forcing slightly mundane shots of Japanese countryside 
and buildings into service as the same assemblages of light and tone the
 rest of the panels are.&nbsp; The drawings collected here are so 
tangible, so vivid and full of visual information, that they subjugate 
pictures of the real world to the status of trompe l’oeil, making 
readers look for the funhouse-mirror Yokoyama logic in the new frames 
before realizing that these pictures are in thrall to that other logic, 
the one outside the book and far away.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-23920" href="http://www.tcj.com/yokoyamas-rubicon-humanitycolortranscendence/yy6/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23920" title="yy6" src="Yokoyama%E2%80%99s%20Rubicon:%20Humanity_%20Color_%20Transcendence%20%7C%20The%20Comics%20Journal_files/yy6.jpg" alt="" height="905" width="650"></a>Everything in <em>Color Engineering</em>
 is calculated for maximum visual impact — the switchups in medium are 
dictated by overarching rhythms and often serve story purposes, but 
they’re there to be pieced together later.&nbsp; The real meat of these 
comics is in surrendering and letting every panel hit with as much force
 as it can muster, to make the sheet of glass or giant drill from last 
panel as fresh and astonishing as it was there in this one. And when a 
double-page spread doesn’t provide enough room for Yokoyama to build to a
 proper crescendo, it’s solved easily enough by one of the many fold-out
 pages, which force actual physical action on the reader, demanding we 
assemble the book in order to be properly blown away by it. If <em>Garden</em> is a book to be read silently, in the stillness of gathering awe, Color Engineering is comics to yell and scream and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lGWATZBsEc&amp;feature=related" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.youtube.com']);">go dumb</a> in your chair to.</p>
<p>The book closes with an encyclopedic restatement of its contents: 
each story re-sequenced from the pyrotechnic, free-flowing layouts that 
we first read them in to tight, neatly balanced grids. These, 
apparently, are the comics as they were first designed — which casts the
 preceding material in a very different light. The main artistic element
 of the book is revealed to be its sequencing: the size to which each 
frame was blown up, the space on the empty spread or fold-out it was put
 down in, the pace at which it fills the pages.&nbsp; These comics 
existed, and then their artist used them to make new comics.&nbsp; It’s a
 final blast of formal genius that trumps all, bringing the focus back 
around to the element of sequential art contained in these pictures, 
they way they’re pieced together. Yokoyama is quite plainly putting on a
 show here, more concerned with the comics medium’s power to scorch 
earth visually than communicate objective information. The beauty of 
this material is to be found most of all in whatever unique messages 
your own eyes pull from its textured canvases, its phased-neon color 
transitions, the precise individual lines that construct its pictures. 
It feels an awful lot like a defining statement for art-comix, a 
contribution of both sheer visual force and statement on form that 
radiates with a singular brilliance.</p>
<p>Like only a few before him, all of whom are enshrined in whatever 
underwhelming immortality comics is capable of giving them, Yokoyama is 
making work so far ahead of the curve that it’s hard to know what to do 
with it. The very idea of Yokoyama rip-off comics seems laughable: this 
is and always has been content that couldn’t possibly be divorced from 
the beautiful lines that create it, and vice versa. It seems unlikely 
indeed that stories about giant machines and uninformed architectural 
criticism will become the next catching thing in comics, and while there
 are plenty of artists working the line between canvas and cartoon or 
figuration and abstraction, none are doing it with such elevated skill 
or such intelligence of theory. With his last three books Yokoyama has 
pulled off a triumph of lit-comics, a triumph of art-comix, and an 
achingly gorgeous thing that sits somewhere in between. As with all 
great works, the only answer is probably to let their effect on the form
 work itself out. Truly special work, after all, only elevates its 
medium. Yokoyama has given us three pieces of art that are very special 
indeed, and it seems to me that the only reaction worth actively 
pursuing is to read them.</p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Ambitious piece, Matt.</p>
<p>Regarding the comparisons to western/American comics: What evidence 
do we have that Yokoyama even sees himself or his work in this context? 
Or is his work strictly a reaction to manga?</p>
<p>I was just a bit taken aback by the suggestion that Yokoyama might 
have worked a Superman reference into Color Engineering. But, then 
again, maybe Dan Nadel has been schooling him on superheroes and Kirby 
and stuff … </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>You mean comparing him to Grant Morrison and stuff?  It’s cause that’s who his comics remind me of.</p>
<p>As far as the Superman reference, I wasn’t ascribing intent there, 
just describing its effect.  Whether or not Yokoyama knows exploding 
planets mean Superman to American readers, that connection exists. </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Right. I didn’t mean to sound dismissive of a very thoughtful and thought-provoking essay.</p>
<p>It just seems like YY, in the end notes to his own books and in the 
very few translated interviews we have with him, seems to purposely 
downplay any narrative elements to his books. I’ve always read him as a 
fine artist working within the manga idiom because of manga’s/comics’ 
unique ability to describe time and space.</p>
<p>“With just a single picture you have no idea about the time before or
 after what appears in it. I wanted draw what happens after the picture,
 to draw time, so I started doing manga.”</p>
<p>YY’s “characters,” such as they are, have always seemed to me to be 
just proxies for the reader, a way to move the reader through his drawn 
world. And what is his purpose beyond world-building? I  think that’s 
still an open question. The obvious artificiality of the landscapes in 
“Travel” and especially “Garden” and “New Engineering” could contain an 
ecological message: the pre-modern, natural world is lost, and we can 
only recreate a false version of it. But I’m not sure about that, 
either.</p>
<p>I have to admit I haven’t thought much more deeply than YY that; I 
found your reading of “Garden” as a brief history of humankind to be 
quite compelling, and I’d pick it up right now if it wasn’t out on loan.</p>
<p>In any case, I think what we really need is more discussion 
(translated into English) with YY about his work. He may be the most 
important comics artist of our time, and definitely is a good candidate 
for TCJ 302. </p>

		<div class="comment-body"><p>Yokoyama’s work reminds me of street 
graffiti. The Rothko reference seems apt as well. Personally, I would 
refrain from any attempt at comparing what he’s doing with American 
comics. Intentional or otherwise, there seems to be a strong resemblance
 to the paintings of Lyonel Feininger, both in structure and colour. 
Feininger was both expressionist artist and cartoonist (Kin-der Kids) so
 maybe the connection is more than just suggestion on my part. Either 
way, from what I see here, Yokoyama’s work is something I am keen to 
explore.</p>
